== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does ThunderTix have any setup fees? =

There are no setup fees for general admission events.
If your event requires a seating chart for assigned seating, there is a one-time fee to build the chart.


= Can the monthly plan can be cancelled at any time? =

We have no contracts or minimum terms.
When your event is over, you can put your account into Maintenance Mode for $10/mo for full report access. This option is great if you have more events in the future to retain all account settings,
seating charts and customer data.
Alternatively, you may simply cancel, and we will delete your account data.


= What day does the billing cycle begin? =

Your billing cycle start date is based on the day you start your plan.
When you first get started, you'll automatically have a 14-day free trial to test out the software. After that point, you have several options:

* Start automatically after your 14-day trial ends
* End the trial early to go live and accept credit card payments sooner
* Extend the trial for additional 14-day periods to go live on whatever date you prefer.
